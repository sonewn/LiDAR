## 1. Structure and operating principles of LiDAR

### LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging)

A LiDAR senseor sends a laser pulse in any particular direction and then we measure the time until a laser pulse hits an external object and is reflected back to the LiDAR is measured.
This measured time is called Time of Flight(ToF). ToF is measured to calculate the distance to the external object.<br>
